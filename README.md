# Quant_Code

This repo is intended to function as a storage unit for all my pertinent Quantitative Finance related code/projects, as I continue to develop a more thorough understanding of the Quant Landscape and grow alongside. 

I hope for the repository to embody my changes and growth as a software developer and as a Quant, so that I may have a tangible place to go and look back on at any given time now, or years down the line, and quantify my growth. 

Housing all my pertinent code in one primarily location is also beneficial for the obvious reasons in regards to future code development. Addittionally, if any individual is ever curious enough and stumbles upon this repo, I hope that they will also be able quanitfy my understanding of Quant Finance and derive the intended value from my code and work. 

At the time that this README is being written, I hope for the code to be split into 4 main areas: Trading Strategies & Systems, Options, Risk Management, Portfolio Management, with more to be added.

If you have made it this far, thank you for your time; I hope that the presented information serves you as intended.
